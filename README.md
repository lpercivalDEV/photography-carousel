# photography-carousel
A simple website I made using HTML, CSS, and JavaScript that showcases photos from some of my favorite photographers in a photo carousel.

# How it's works:

**Tech Used: HTML,CSS,JAVASCRIPT**

This is a simple javascript application that allows users to cycle through an array of images like a digital photography carousel. Users can move forward or backwards to view the images as they appear on the "editing desk." The collection holds sample placeholder photos from some of my favorite photographers. But this app could be easily repurposed and restyled to display any number of images in a carousel fashion.
